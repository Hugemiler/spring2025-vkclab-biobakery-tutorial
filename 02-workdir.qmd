# 🖥️ Getting Oriented in the Shell

::: callout-warning
You need to be inside the Wellesley network (via campus WiFi, wired ethernet or VPN) to access `HesseHub`
:::

You can access **HesseHub** by navigating to [this link](http://10.131.0.41:8080/guacamole). Use the provided username and password (`hessehub:hessehub`) to log into the system, and pick the virtual machine assigned to you.

::: callout-tip
Machines are identified by name. The following VMs are available:
- `AstuteAdenine`
- `BrilliantBacillus`
- `CuriousClostridium`
- `DiligentDrosophila`
- `ExcitedEscherichia`
- `FastidiousFirmicute`
- `HelpfulHaemophilus`
- `InquisitiveInfluenza`
:::

Now that you've logged into **HesseHub**, it's time to get your bearings. This section will introduce basic Linux shell commands you’ll use often during your internship.

## 🧭 Navigating the Filesystem

### 🔹 `pwd` — "print working directory"
Displays your current location in the filesystem.

```bash
pwd
```

---

### 🔹 `ls` — "list"
Lists the contents of a directory.

```bash
ls -lah
```

---

### 🔹 `cd` — "change directory"
Use `cd` to move around.

```bash
cd ~
cd ..
cd /opt
```

---

## 🗂️ Creating Your Working Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/hesse-tutorial/{zipfiles,rawfastq,kneaddata,metaphlan,humann}
cd ~/hesse-tutorial
```

---

## 📋 Copy and Customize a Script

We’ve prepared a validation script to help you confirm your folder structure. You’ll personalize it by providing the location of your working directory (`~/hesse-tutorial`).

### 🔹 Step 1: Copy the script

```bash
cp ~/tutorial/validate-structure.sh .
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Edit the validation script

Open the script in `vim` and edit line 13 according to the instructions in the file.

```bash
vim validate-structure.sh
```

Look for the lines:

```bash
###----EDIT THE NEXT LINE WITH THE PATH/NAME OF YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY----###
#WORKDIR={{your-work-dir}}
###---------AFTER YOU DO IT, UNCOMMENT THE LINE (REMOVE THE "#")----------###
```

And replace `{{your-work-dir}}` with a valid path to your working directory (`~/hesse-tutorial`). To do that, use arrow keys to navigate the file, then press the key `a` a single time to enter `"insert"` mode. Proceed to delete the placeholder and type in the path in question. Save and quit by pressing `ESC` and then typing `:wq`.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x validate-structure.sh
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Run it

```bash
./validate-structure.sh
```

If your folders are correct and your intern key matches, you'll unlock the next phase!
